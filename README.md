GDD For my individual project for the course: Introduction to Game Making - Code Coven

# Overview

## Game Concept

A 2D puzzle game about a young kid and their tamagotchi friend that came to life.

## Genre

2D platform puzzle game.

## Target Audience

People that like puzzles, with average knowledge of video game controls since the change in characters may not be beginner friendly?

## Platforms

PC.

## Scope (MVP)

-   Level: one single level with one puzzle.
-   Mechanics: controlling each character separately, changing between them to solve the puzzle.
    -   Character A (kid): walk fast, jump, crouch?, tiny so they can go in small spaces, can collect items
    -   Character B (golem): walk slow, tall so they can be used as a block for the kid to reach higher places, can destroy certain walls/surfaces?
-   Art: I would like to at least have sketches for all the elements of the level, maybe playing around the idea of unfinished art?
